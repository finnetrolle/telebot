  "body": "# xXDEATHXx telegram bot\r\n\r\nTelegram bot for notifications broadcasting.\r\n \r\nVersion 0.0 - pre alpha or even a proof oc concept. Using this version is very risky!\r\n\r\n## What is it?\r\n\r\nThis bot is a simple telegram notifier. I hope once you can start bot and send anything to all your pals in ally\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n- install and configure database (prefer postgres)\r\n- create database and user for your telebot instance\r\n- `git clone` application\r\n- `mvn -U clean install -P production`\r\n- add application.properties file\r\n- `sudo rm /etc/init.d/telebot` if you already have previous version of telebot\r\n- `sudo ln -s /path-to-app/telebot.jar /etc/init.d/telebot`\r\n- `sudo service telebot start`\r\n\r\nTomcat have a problem with slow startup. To fix it just install haveged\r\n`sudo apt-get install haveged -y`\r\n\r\n## Service configuration\r\n\r\n## Setting up your system\r\n\r\n### Super user\r\nYour service need special user that nobody can demote. This user is moderator by default and even if one of your \r\nmoderators dicide to kick all other moderators you still have a chance to take control. \r\nSet eve character name into superuser property to enable superuser. \r\n\r\nNext step is to attach your telegram account to this character. Open telegram and register using **/register** \r\ncommand with your keyId and vCode. Without saying you should select character with superuser's name. If you want to\r\nshow your character's name in moderator list - **/promote** yourself (This is not necessary to superuser to be a moderator)\r\n\r\n### Add your first alliance or corporation\r\nAt first your service have empty lists for allowed alliances and corporations. This is a time when every person having\r\nEve Online character can register into your system. To prevent registering for all except your friends you should add\r\nsome alliances or corporations into service. \r\n\r\nUse **/addally** and **/addcorp** commands to fulfill your allowed lists. If you have at least one alliance or \r\none corporation, nobody can register except the pilots of added alliance / corporation.\r\n\r\n### Promote moderators\r\nYou probably need help of your friends to make broadcasts, remove alliances and corporations from allowed lists and \r\nmake a coffee. Add some helpers using **/promote** command. Your moderators can promote and demote any person except \r\nsuper user, so your person is safe. But don't make your servants a slaves because they can make some problems \r\nfor your system.\r\n\r\n## Next version named 'Users to manage' is 0.1\r\n\r\n### Superuser in properties file\r\nOne user to rule them all. Moderator by default, can not be moved away. Can execute any command.\r\n\r\n### Allowed ally and corp list\r\nPeriodically, system will check every user for corporation and alliance. If registered user's alliance or corporation\r\nis in one of the lists - he'll get his broadcasts. In other way this user will be marked 'left' to ignore broadcasts. \r\nMarked users will be also removed from moderators list. User can remove his mark after welcoming in listed corp or ally.\r\nBut only other moderator can return moderator access back to him.\r\n\r\n### Check-before-broadcast\r\nIn fact broadcast will be sent only to users without 'left' mark to make broadcast faster. But there will be a component\r\nscanning every unmarked person with eve api to find renegades. Administrator will be able to set time between scans.\r\n\r\n### Add/remove ally or corp from list\r\nThis feature will be available in bot's chat (only for moderators).\r\n\r\n- **/addally** [ticker] *to add ally into list*\r\n- **/rmally** [ticker] *to remove ally from list*\r\n- **/la** *to show allys list*\r\n- **/addcorp** [id] *to add corp into list*\r\n- **/rmcorp** [ticker] *to remove corp from list*\r\n- **/lc** *to show corp list*\r\n\r\n### Unsecured API to make broadcast\r\nYou'll be able to make broadcast from unsecured endpoint like http://mybothost:8080/cast with POST method. \r\nNo login and password is needed to access this endpoint so you should be careful.\r\n\r\n### Add/remove moderators\r\nThis feature will give you a way to have more than one moderator.\r\n\r\n- **/promote** [name] *to promote pilot to moderator*\r\n- **/demote** [name] *to demote pilot from moderator*\r\n- **/lm** *to show all moderators*\r\n\r\n### RPM and easy install guide\r\nApplication is already is executable (it means you shouldn't exec java -jar), but you still need git and maven to build it.\r\nIn this patch you'll get RPM package with settings file and you'll can install it with help of easy install guide.\r\n\r\nYou will also have an opportunity to build application from sources with maven.\r\n\r\n### Liquibase\r\nHibernate is ok with table creation, but if we want to keep your production database up-to-date with new versions of \r\napplication, we must use liquibase.\r\n \r\n### Optional enhancements\r\n- It is a nice idea to make just one page to make registration an easy process because nobody want to copy keyID and vCode to phone\r\n- Embedded database is perfect to make installation easy. H2 is nice and have a chance to replace postgres\r\n- Jabber listener will listen to one jabber person (You'll can find a friend to your old jabber bot!)\r\n\r\n",
